 # speedtest_ext.sh
 
 Must have speedtest installed | Check speedtest cli page for more info https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli

This script uses speedtest and adds some options like outputing the results into a txt file, number of tests and converting the speed from megabits to megabytes 

This script was made for testing purposes on my network but tought others might find it usefull and expand on it

# !IMPORTANT NOTE! 

if used many times you will get a timeout until you can do a speed test again | This is from ookla's side not the script

-h command to display the options available with the script
